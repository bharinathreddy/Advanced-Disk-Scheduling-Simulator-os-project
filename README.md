📀 Disk Scheduling Simulator
📌 Project Overview

The Disk Scheduling Simulator is a web-based application that demonstrates and visualizes popular disk scheduling algorithms used in operating systems.
It allows users to input custom disk access requests and observe how different algorithms optimize seek time and improve system performance.

This project helps students understand FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, and C-SCAN algorithms through interactive execution and performance metrics.
