📀 Disk Scheduling Simulator
📌 Project Overview

The Disk Scheduling Simulator is a web-based application that demonstrates and visualizes popular disk scheduling algorithms used in operating systems.
It allows users to input custom disk access requests and observe how different algorithms optimize seek time and improve system performance.

This project helps students understand FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, and C-SCAN algorithms through interactive execution and performance metrics.



🎯 Objectives

Simulate disk scheduling algorithms in a simple and interactive way

Visualize disk head movement

Compare performance of different algorithms

Calculate and display performance metrics such as seek time and throughput

🧠 Algorithms Implemented

FCFS (First Come First Serve)

Processes disk requests in the order they arrive

Simple but inefficient for large workloads

SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)

Selects the request closest to the current head position

Reduces seek time but may cause starvation

SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)

Disk head moves in one direction servicing requests

Reverses direction at the end

C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)

Head moves in one direction only

Provides uniform wait time
